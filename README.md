# things-i-forget

---
A running tabulation of installation and use notes of things that I don't do very often (or are doing for the first time) and therefore have a tendency to forget.
---

Since these notes are often written as I'm learning things, they are prone to errors or not necessarily the best way of doing things.  Use at your own risk.
